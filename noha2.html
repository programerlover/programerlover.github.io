                    With the passage of time, the temples fell into disuse and eventually became covered by sand. 
                    By the 6th century BC, the sand already covered the statues of the main temple up to
                    eir knees. The temple was forgotten until 1813, when Swiss researcher
                     Johann Ludwig Burckhardt found the top frieze of the main temple.
                      Burckhardt talked about his discovery

                    During his reign, Ramesses II embarked on an extensive building program throughout Egypt and Nubia, 
                    which Egypt controlled. Nubia was very important to the Egyptians because it was a source of gold 
                    and many other precious trade goods. He, therefore, built several grand temples there in order to
                     impress upon the Nubians Egypt's might and Egyptianizend

                    last year, the illumination was attended by 6,500 tourists who usually gather before dawn to witness the light shedding on the 22-metre-long statue
                     slowly starting from face of the statue, expanding to the surrounding giant statues
                    Ramses II also known as Ramesses II or Ramesses the Great was the third pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt and known
                 to be the most powerful pharaoh of the New Kingdom.
                    The sun festival occurs on 22 October and 22 February.
                    These dates are believed to signify the birthday of the Ramses II and the day 
                    he ascended to the throne. On each of these two days, when the sun enters the temple at dawn, 
                    the rays illuminate the statues at the back wall only, except for Ptah, the god of the underworld. 
                    It is quite a feat that this was achieved in ancient Egypt, considering the technology and knowledge of astronomy that
                     was available.
