        <p class="fourv">saqqara</p>
        <p class="fivev">Horemheb (c.1323–1295 BC) was the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Prior to his ascension to the throne, during the reign of Tutankhamun (c.1336–1327 BC), he was the highest‑ranking military officer in the realm, and held other titles as lofty
            as “the King’s Deputy in the Entire Land”. He was ultimately buried in the Valley of the Kings as would befit his royal status. Before this, however, Horemheb had naturally begun work on another tomb, in Saqqara. This tomb is the largest in
            the New Kingdom cemetery south of the causeway of the Fifth Dynasty King Unas (c.2375–2345 BC). Like the other major tombs in this cemetery, it is a temple‑tomb, so named because it reflects the structure of contemporary great state temples.
            It is entered through a pylon gateway preceding two open‑air courtyards that themselves precede the inner rooms of the chapel, where Horemheb’s cult was practised. The central room was surmounted by a pyramid, a solar symbol of rebirth. The
            burial chamber was underground, accessed through a vertical shaft cut through the floor of the inner courtyard. The discovery of the bones of a fetus along with a female skeleton, possibly of Horemheb’s wife Mutnedjmet, in his Memphite tomb
            shows that it did not go unused. The reliefs in this tomb include scenes depicting Horemheb carrying out his duties. One scene shows representatives of foreign rulers pleading before Tutankhamun, with Horemheb acting as intermediary. Two scenes
            in particular show his exalted status prior to his rise to kingship. Here, he is depicted followed by rows of foreign captives, being publicly rewarded with the Gold of Honor by Tutankhamun himself. The Gold of Honor was awarded by kings to
            their officials for exceptional service. The tomb is decorated with funerary scenes as well, one of which depicts the Opening of the Mouth ritual. The location of this tomb was not always known. It was discovered in the early 19th century,
            when this area of Saqqara was explored by tomb‑robbers and art dealers, who then sold their findings to museums and collectors abroad. These were not limited to statues and other portable objects. Entire sections of wall relief were removed,
            and none of the provenance was recorded. Horemheb’s Memphite tomb was particularly affected, and its location was subsequently forgotten. Thankfully, it and the New Kingdom cemetery were eventually rediscovered in 1975.</p>

        <p class="hor">The tomb from the time in which he was not yet Pharaoh Horemheb was discovered a first time in the 19th century, then it disappeared again under the sands. It was rediscovered in 1975 by Geoffrey Martin and his team who cleared the monument in
            four seasons of excavation. Nothing precise is known about the career of Horemheb before the reign of Tutankhamun, but it is certain that he didn't arrive overnight to the position of Generalissimo of the army, uppermost of all works of the
            king and Regent to the young king. Some have proposed to recognise Horemheb (Hor-em-Heb = Horus is in festival) in one close to Akhenaton, a soldier by the name of Paatenemheb (Pa-Aten-em-Heb = The Aton is in festival). When Horemheb makes
            Memphis, under Tutankhamun, the place to construct his tomb he is to the summit of his power, but nothing indicates a future royal destiny.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">However that may be, Horemheb doesn't speak of his parentage, which suggests that he was probably of modest origin and that he was a self-made man. One knows that his family was from Herakleopolis, close to the entry of the Fayum, whose tutelary god
        was Herishef, a god with the head of a ram. Nevertheless no monument of this city makes allusion to Horemheb, and it seems that he had no particular devotion for its god, no more that he erected a place of cult worship there for his family (at
        least nothing has been found). Erik Hornung thinks that his place of birth was probably located in the nome of the Falcon, the 18th nome of Upper Egypt. However that may be, Horemheb always showed a particular devotion to the Great Falcon God
        Horus, with whom one often finds him represented during his reign, as in the statuary group of Vienna.</p>
