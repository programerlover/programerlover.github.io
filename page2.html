            <p>The temple of Seti I also known as the Great Temple of Abydos is one of the main historical sites in Abydos. The temple was built by pharaoh Seti I. At the rear of the temple there is the Osireion<br> The temple is also notable for the Abydos
                graffiti, ancient Phoenician and Aramaic graffiti found on the temple walls.
                <br> King Seti I began constructing the temple in the late eighties of the thirteenth century, and its construction and inscriptions were completed by his son, King Ramses II, who are among the kings of the 19th dynasty.</p>

        <h3>Some temple inscriptions</h3>
        <div class="s">
            <img src="assets/images/bardy.jpg">
            <p>Most of the temple is built of white limestone, and its columns are of sandstone, L-shaped, unlike the pharaonic temples that are used to the rectangular design. It includes 24 columns, in the form of papyrus bundles, and their crowns are
                in the form of a flower that did not bloom. These columns are organized into two rows, each row of 12 columns, inscribed with scenes from different aspects of the life of Ramses II. One scene depicts Khnum, the god of creation and water,
                and a second scene shows Ramses The second sponsored by Hathor and Isis, and another scene from the king's purification ceremony, these columns form corridors leading to another hall</p>

        <h3>Some columns of the temple</h3>

            <img src="assets/images/amod.jpg" width="500" height="900">
            <p>As for the second hall, it includes 36 columns arranged in three rows, each row has 12 columns as well. The third row is slightly elevated in a way that makes it look like a sloping rise, unlike the incline of one of two degrees facing the
                middle aisle made by the rows of columns. The columns are usually shortened in all ancient Egyptian temples, the closer the person approaches the prayer niche, due to the low level of the roof of the temples, but in the Temple of Abydos
                The columns shorten due to the natural elevation of the ground as we approach the niches,The inscriptions that were decorated with the columns of that hall date back to the era of Seti I , and it is one of the most beautiful things made
                by the ancient Egyptian example,since the gods who were represented with human heads were engraved in the same side position as the statue of King Seti I, and the second hall ends with 7 prayer halls, starting from The right is in the
                niche of Hor, followed by the niche of Isis, then Osiris, Amun, Hor my sister, meaning the chief of the gods, and Ptah, and the last hall towards the left is the mihrab of Seti I.It is noted that the niches did not have doors behind them
                except the niche of Osiris, and it had a door that leads to a hall with pillars Wallpaper featuring the trinity of deities Osiris, Isis and Horus.</p>

            <p>Erected in 1892, it was first built in a five-room apartment, inside one small building on Rosetta Street (later Avenue Canope and now Horriya). In 1895, it was transferred to another, larger building near Gamal Abdul Nasser Street. The museum
                contains several pieces dating from the Greco-Roman (Ptolemaic) era in the 3rd century BC, such as a sculpture of Apis in black granite, the sacred bull of the Egyptians, mummies, sarcophagus, tapestries, and other objects offering a view
                of Greco-Roman civilization in contact with ancient Egypt.

        <div class="fv">
            <img src="assets/images/r2.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" class="mg">
            <p>The museum contains material found in Alexandria itself; Ptolemaic and Roman objects from the Nile River delta, Al-Fayyūm of Upper Egypt, and Middle Egypt; and antiquities from the pharaonic period from the Alexandria area and the delta. Among
                the objects in the collection are a cast of the Rosetta Stone (the original was removed to the British Museum) and fine pieces of Hellenistic sculpture, including a large Attic funerary stela of the late 4th century BCE. There is a colossal
                porphyry statue representing an emperor or Jesus Christ, found outside the Attarin Mosque, Alexandria, and believed to be the largest example known in that material. Among the many other objects in the collection are terra-cottas, Tanagra
                figurines, capitals, pottery, silver objects, and coins.</p>

            <p> Egyptians had unique lifestyle and rare taste in their architectural buildings, and the Romans followed the same policy by building pharaonic temples and cities but with a touch of Roman's art. 30 B.C was the official year of ending the Egyptian
                rule over Egypt and declaring the Roman domination, but Egypt managed to remain independent and Egyptians tried to stick to their traditions and religious customs. In many invasion cases, the occupied nation mostly get effected by the
                foreign invaders, but it seems like it went the opposite way in which the Roman were extremely influenced by the Egyptian's life style and civilization. They believed in their religious gods, created similar tombs and temples, depicted
                themselves as pharaohs on the walls of the temples and wore their clothes.
