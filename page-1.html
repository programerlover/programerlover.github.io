        alt="Luxor temple" title="Luxor temple">
    <p>The Luxor Temple is a large temple of ancient Egyptian temples, located on the eastern bank of the Nile River in
        the city of Luxor today, known as (Old Taybah). It was established in the year 1400 BC. The Luxor Temple was
        built to the worship of Amon Ra, his wife, death
        and their son Khonsu; It is the depths that are also called the Tibi Trinity (Good Three). The Luxor Temple was
        built
        during the eighteenth family kings and the nineteenth family. The most important buildings in the temple are
        those that
        were built by the two kingdoms, the third (1397-1360 BC) and Ramses II (1290-1223 BC) (which was added to the
        temple of
        the open courtyard, the edifice and the two preaching). King Tuthmosis III (1490-1436 BC) also established
        meters for
        the visitors of the Tiba Al-Maqdis, and Tutankhamun (1348-1337 BC) also completed the inscriptions of his walls.
        The
        triple cabin that had been constructed before during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut and King Tuthmosis III (from
        the
        eighteenth family); Then it was rebuilt during the reign of King Ramses II. The temple was also named "Eps
        Rasit"
        (meaning the southern campus or the place of Amun Ra). It is one of the best and most beautiful Egyptian
        temples, in
        which the planning of the Egyptian temple is evident.</p>
    <h3>The date of the construction of the temple</h3>
    <p class="lt"> The era of the middle state: It is possible that there was in the same region where the third was
        established, the third temple, the remains of an ancient temple or a sacred cabin dating back to the era of the
        middle state, and most likely it was in the era of the twelfth family.<br>King Aminat III: Thanks to the
        construction of the temple in its current image on the eastern bank of the Nile on one axis from north to south
        to
        Amenotop III from the kings of the eighteenth family.
        <br>Queen Hatshepsut and King Tuthmosis III: They constructed a small building consisting of three meters
        allocated
        to the Tiba Tiba.
        <br>King Ramses II: King Ramses II added from the kings of the nineteenth family, a large and vicious spacious
        yard
        with papyrus.
    </p>
    <h3>Naming the temple</h3>
    <p>Apit Rast: The Egyptians called this temple the name "Ap Rast", which may mean the southern harem (where the
        death of
        Amon's wife) or the southern cabin lives ..</p>

    <h2>Valley of the Kings</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/وادى الملوك.jpg" alt="Valley of the Kings" height="500px" width="1500px">
    <h3>About the Valley of the Kings</h3>
    <p>The Valley of the Kings is also known as the "Valley of the Bebin Kings", it is a valley in Egypt used for 500
        years during the period between the sixteenth and eleventh centuries BC to construct the graves of the pharaohs
        and nobles of the modern state that extends during the eighteenth family of the family to the twentieth family
        in ancient Egypt, and it is located The Valley is on the West Bank of the Nile River in the face of Taibah
        (currently Luxor) in the heart of the old funerary city of Taiba. The Valley of the Kings is divided into two
        valleys; Eastern Valley (where most of the royal tombs are located) and the Western Valley.<br>With the
        discovery of the last burial chamber in 2006 known as (Cemetery 63) in addition to the discovery of two other
        entrances to the same room during 2008, the number of graves discovered so far reached 63 cemetery of varying
        sizes, as it ranges from a small hole on the ground to a complex cemetery that contains more than 120 A burial
        room inside. All of these graves were used in the burial of the kings and princes of the modern state in ancient
        Egypt, in addition to some nobles and who was related to the ruling family at that time. The royal graves are
        distinguished by containing drawings and inscriptions of ancient Egyptian mythology that explain religious
        beliefs and memorial ceremonies at that time. And all the discovered graves were opened and looted in ancient
        times, and despite this, it remained intense evidence of the power and prosperity of the kings of that time.<br>
        <tab>This region is a center for scout excavations to study archaeology and Egyptology since the end of the
            eighteenth century, as its graves arouse the attention of scholars to expand such studies and archaeological
            excavations. The valley was famous in the modern era after the discovery of Tutankhamun's complete cemetery
            and the rumors around it regarding the curse of the Pharaohs, and the valley remained famous for the
            archaeological excavations spread among it until it was adopted as a world heritage site in 1979 in addition
            to the entire funerary city of Taiba. Detection, exploration and restoration operations are still ongoing in
            the Valley of the Kings so far, and a tourist center has recently been opened there.
    </p>
    <p>The Tiba hills are located in which the Valley of the Kings is located in one of the areas exposed to severe
        thunderstorms, and recent studies have confirmed that seven active flood paths are at the very least that are in
        the heart of the valley, which is the region that reports indicate that they were exposed to floods at the end
        of the eighteenth family era, which is what It led to the disappearance of many graves under flood deposits,
        which was confirmed by excavation and exploration during the discovery of both Cemetery 63, Cemetery 62 and
        Cemetery 55, which was revealed in the actual rocky ground of the valley, which was covered by the floods. For
        more than five meters from its level now. In the aftermath of the eighteenth family, the Pharaohs worked to
        settle the land of the valley, and then the floods gathered away from the graves area, and then these graves
        remained reserved until they were discovered in the late twentieth century, that flat area of ​​the land was
        subject to study within the framework of the project to restore the royal graves in Amarna, which confirmed The
        area of ​​the area of ​​the area is the presence of many differences below the surface of the earth later. One
        of these formative differences is the recently discovered cemetery.</p>
    <h3>Explore the valley</h3>
    <p>The Valley of the Kings is one of the largest areas of archaeological exploration related to Egyptology over the
        past two centuries, after it was just a tourist attraction in ancient times (especially the days of the Roman
        era), as this region was a witness to the transformation that affected the methodology of studying the history
        of ancient Egypt and which started From theft of antiquities and the looting of the graves until it has reached
        what it has now from scientific explorations that unveiled the entire funeral city of Taibah, and despite all
        these explorations, there were no more than eleven graves that were completely documented after knowing all the
        details related to it and its owners.<br>
        And many graves contain inscriptions on their walls behind the tourists a long time ago, as the researcher, Jul
        Paylier, identified more than 2100 inscriptions on the walls of the graves in Latin and Greek languages ​​in
        addition to a fewer number of inscriptions 9 in which nearly a thousand inscriptions were found dating back to
        about 278 BC.<br>
        By 1799, the first map of the locations of the graves discovered until that time was drawn up, and this work is
        due to the scholars of the French campaign against Egypt, especially the Dominic Vevent, as it was noted for the
        first time the presence of the Western Valley (where both Parospir Julouh and Edward de Velier de Terra were
        identified the Amenhotep III Cemetery website known as Cemetery 22 ) The description of Egypt also included two
        volumes out of twenty -four volumes containing a complete debate for the observations of the campaign scholars
        and their description of the area surrounding the goodness.
        <br>The European scouting campaigns continued after this date with the early nineteenth century out of the
        success of Champollion in deciphering the hieroglyphic writing, so the scouting campaigns began led by Balzoni,
        entrusted by Henry Solt, and indeed Balzoni was able to discover many cemeteries, including; The Cemetery of
        Khukhro Rai in the Western Valley (Cemetery 23) in 1816, then City Cemetery (Cemetery 17) in the following year,
        and with the end of his visit to the region, Balzoni announced that what was found during this exploratory
        campaign is the maximum that can be found and nothing remains. It is valuable to excavate it, and it is reported
        that in the meantime the French Consul General Bernardino Darviti (rival Balzoni and Solt) was also working
        alone in the same research area.
        <br>With the re -assumption of Juston Maspero to head the Egyptian Antiquities Authority, the method of
        exploration in the valley changed, as Maspero appointed Howard Carter as head of inspectors in Upper Egypt, and
        the young man has already succeeded in discovering many new graves in addition to his contributions to revealing
        the two cemetery 42 and Cemetery 20.
        <br>The entrance to the Cemetery of Hormis, immediately after its discovery in 1908.
        <br>With the dawn of the twentieth century, American lawyer Theodore Davis succeeded in obtaining permission to
        research and exploration in the region from the Egyptian government, and his team led by British Egyptian
        scientist Edward Russell Ariston succeeded in revealing many royal and non -ownership cemeteries (including
        cemetery 43, cemetery 46 and cemetery 57) And they also succeeded in finding evidence of the cowardly of the
        Amarna era in the cemetery 55, after which they extracted the remaining effects of Tutankhamun buried from the
        two graves, Cemetery 54 and Cemetery 58, and they announced the end of exploration in the Valley of the Kings
        forever and the inability to find any traces or other graves

    <h2>Pyramid of Red</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/red.jpg" alt="pyramid of red" width="1500px" height="500">
    <p><span>Pyramid of Red</span>, also known as the North Pyramid, is the largest pyramid located at Dahshur in Giza
        in Egypt. Named
        because of the rusty red color of its red limestone stones, this pyramid is also the third largest Egyptian
        pyramid,
        after the pyramid of Khufu and Khafre in Giza. It is also believed to be the first successful Egyptian attempt
        to build
        a smooth-sided "real" pyramid. The locals refer to the red pyramid as the "Bat Pyramid",
        &#160;The red pyramid was not always red. It was encased in white Tora limestone, but now only a few of these
        stones remain at
        the base of the pyramid, at the corner. During the Middle Ages, much of the white Tora limestone was taken for
        buildings
        in Cairo, revealing the red limestone beneath.<br><br>
    
    <h3>pyramid attribution</h3>
    <P>The reason for the attribution to Sneferu is originally due to the fact that the neighboring cemetery contained
        only the
        tombs of the officials of this king. In addition, the decision of King Pepi I, located in the valley temple,
        refers to
        the city of the pyramid of Sneferu. This attribution can be confirmed, because in the area of ​​the accompanying
        temple,
        a limestone block with remains of hieroglyphs was found in this place, in the name of King Horus: Neb-Maat (one
        of the
        royal titles of King Sneferu) (‘nb-m3ˁ.t’).</P><br>
    <h3>exploration</h3>
    <p>Della Vallee gave the first description of the first two rooms of the pyramid when he visited the pyramid in the
        winter
        of 1615/1616. Edward Melton visited the Red Pyramid in 1660, as did the Bohemian Franciscan missionary Vaclav
        Remedios
        Protky in the 18th century. Robert Wood, James Dawkins, and Giovanni Battista Porra conducted a preliminary
        survey in
        1750, but were unable to reach the burial chamber since they did not have a proper staircase.</p>
    <p>Early in the archaeological exploration of the Red Pyramid were the investigations of John Chee Bering in 1839
        and the
        Prussian Lipsius Expedition in 1843. The pyramid was cataloged by Carl Richard Lepsius in Lipsius' List of the
        Pyramids.
        This was followed by studies by Flinders Petrie and George Reisner. From 1944, more detailed research followed
        Abd
        al-Salam Husayn and from 1951 Ahmed Fakhry. However, this work has not been published. It was not until 1982
        that a
        thorough and systematic investigation was carried out by Rainer Stadelmann.</p>
    <p>The pyramid complex was in a restricted military zone until the mid-1990s and is currently the site of several
        excavations. A labor settlement of builders and a cemetery were found in the area.</p>
    <h3>Date</h3>
    <p>The Red Pyramid is the third pyramid built by King Sneferu, and is located approximately one kilometer north of
        the
        Leaning Pyramid of Sneferu. It was built at the same shallow 43-degree angle as the top of the curved pyramid,
        giving it
        a distinctly seated appearance compared to other Egyptian pyramids of similar size. It is believed that
        construction
        began during the thirtieth year of the reign of Sneferu (about 2590 BC). Egyptologists disagree about the length
        of time
        it took to build. Based on quarry marks found in various stages of construction, Rainer Stadelmann estimates the
        time of
        completion to be around 17 years while Rolf Krause, based on this graffiti, suggests a period of 10-11 years of
        construction, an estimate later supported by John Romer (Egyptologist ).</p>
    <p>Archaeologists speculate that its design may have been the result of engineering crises that occurred during the
        construction of the previous Sneferu pyramids. The first, the Pyramid of Meidum in Meidum, collapsed in
        antiquity, while
        the second, the bent pyramid of Sneferu, its angle of inclination changed dramatically from 54 to 43 degrees
        through
        masonry.</p>
    <p>Some archaeologists now believe that Meidum's pyramid was the first attempt to build a smooth pyramid, that it
        may have
        collapsed when construction of the curved pyramid had already begun - and that by then the pyramid may already
        have
        begun to show disturbing signs of instability in itself, as Evidenced by the presence of large wooden beams
        supporting
        its interior rooms. The result of this was a change in the slope of the curved pyramid, and the later starting
        of the
        red pyramid at a slope known to be less prone to instability and therefore less prone to catastrophic collapse.
    </p>
    <h3>The modern era</h3>
    <p>The height of the Red Pyramid is 105 meters (344 feet). A rare pyramid, or coronation stone, of the Red Pyramid
        was
        uncovered and reconstructed, and is now on display in Dahshur. However, it is unclear whether it was actually
        used at
        all, as the angle of its inclination differs from that of the pyramid it was supposed to use.</p>
    <P>The Red Pyramid, along with the leaning pyramid of Sneferu, has been closed to tourists for many years due to the
        presence of an army camp nearby. It is usually open to tourists and a somewhat intrusive ventilation has been
        installed
        so that the air is directed down the entrance shaft into the inner rooms. Visitors climb the stairs cut or built
        over
        the stones of the pyramid to a high entrance on the north side. A corridor, 3 feet (0.91 m) high and 4 feet (1.2
        m)
        wide, slopes down at 27 degrees for 200 feet (61 m) into a short horizontal corridor that leads to a room whose
        arched
        ceiling is 40 feet (12 m) high and rises in one ten degrees. At the southern end of the room, but to the west,
        another
        short horizontal corridor leads to the second room. This passage may have been closed at one time and the
        displacement
        was an action intended to confuse potential thieves.</P>
    <p>The second room is similar to the first room and is located directly under the top of the pyramid. There is an
        entrance
        at the top of the room's south wall, now accessed by a large wooden staircase built for the convenience of
        tourists.
        This gives a short horizontal corridor that leads to the third and final room with a 50 ft (15 m) archedceiling.
        The first two rooms have a long axis aligned north-south, but the long axis of this room is aligned Between East
        and West.
        In contrast to the first two rooms, which had smooth smooth floors at the same level as the corridors,
        the floor of the third room was very rough and sunk below the level of the access corridor. This is believed
        to be the work of thieves searching for treasure in what is believed to be the pyramid's burial chamber.</p>
    <h3>pyramid</h3>
    <p>The pyramid rests on a foundation made of several layers of high-quality limestone from Tora. On the other hand,
        the
        core of the pyramid is made of reddish limestone blocks that were extracted from quarries in the immediate
        vicinity of
        the pyramid. The current name of the red pyramid comes from the coloring of this substance. Inscriptions with
        dates have
        been found on several blocks of built material.</p>
    <p>red pyramid structure
        The founding block is dated to "The Year of the Fifteenth Count of Cattle," the most recent inscription in the
        "Year of
        the Twenty-fourth Count of Cattle." Based on the information found, one can conclude - provided that a census of
        cattle
        is taken every two years - that about one-fifth of the pyramid was built within two years. However, the two-year
        cycle
        of the cattle census is not undisputed.</p>
    <p>The pyramid was built using improved techniques already used at the top of the leaning pyramid of Sneferu. The
        stone
        layers were now horizontal from the beginning, so that the pressure inside the pyramid did not increase, which
        led to
        cracks and the danger of collapse of the chambers inside the leaning pyramid of Sneferu. As for the upper side
        surfaces,
        the angle of inclination is now set to less than 44 degrees. John Shay Bering gives it 43° 36' 11", based on the
        remaining stones of the cladding, with a basic dimension equal to 219.3 m and a height of 104.4 m m. This angle
        defined
        by Bering corresponds to an ancient Egyptian angle of 7.35 sec, i.e. a tangent of 7 / 7.35 ( = 20/21.Using this
        angle of
        inclination, a height similar to that of a curved pyramid of about 105 m (200 cubits) can be achieved by greatly
        increasing the length of the base to about 220 m (420 cubits).The lateral surfaces of the pyramid core have a
        slightly
        concave crease. It extends upward from the center of the base.This would improve the stability of the cladding
        attached
        to it.Unlike previous buildings, the pyramid was completed without any changes to the plan.</p>
    <p>In 1982, R. Stadelmann discovered pyramid fragments in the ruins of Dahshur in front of the eastern side of the
        pyramid,
        which are considered to be the oldest of all those found so far and like only two others from the Egyptian
        Fourth
        Dynasty pyramid of the Old Kingdom. The reassembled and restored pyramid is now placed in the precinct of the
        mortuary
        temple in front of the Red Pyramid, and consists, like the cladding of the pyramid, of fine Tora limestone. It
        is made
        of a monolithic block and measures a cubit (about 1.57 m) at its base, the sides have an angle of inclination of
        about
        54°, which is not exactly symmetrical. This pyramid is much steeper than the remaining remnants of the Red
        Pyramid or
        the upper part of the adjacent older pyramid, the Pyramid of Sneferu (about 43°) and is as steep as its lower
        part.
        There are neither inscriptions nor references to the attachment of the metal plates, which according to
        Herodotus'
        report are said to have been on the edges of the pyramids.</p>
    <H3>Infrastructure</H3>
    <h4>Room tidying</h4>
    <p>All the corridors and rooms of the red pyramid are located above the base of the pyramid in the heart of the
        bricks. It
        is the first and only pyramid that does not have underground passages. The reason may lie in the increasing
        identification of the king with the sun god Ra, however, for purely practical reasons, the acceleration of work
        on the
        pyramid by dispensing with the underground components can be conceivable. Although the rooms are above ground,
        they are
        built on shallow pits at a depth of about 10 meters</p>
    <h4>pyramid entrance</h4>
    <p>The entrance to the pyramid is located on the north wall at a height of 28 meters and is moved 4 meters from the
        central
        axis to the east. The descending passage leads down 62.63 meters at an angle of 27 degrees to the base of the
        pyramid.
        This trail has a height of 0.91 meters and a width of 1.23 meters. At the foot of the descending corridor is a
        short
        shaft that was supposed to prevent rainwater from entering the rooms during construction. From there, a short
        horizontal
        corridor leads to the first antechamber. Stone fall barriers are not available.</p>
    <p>The two waiting rooms have identical dimensions. With a length of 8.36 meters and a width of 3.65 meters, the
        eleven
        level cantilevered vaults rise to a height of 12.31 meters. In terms of design and visual impact, it is the
        forerunner
        of the Great Exhibition of the Pyramid of Khufu. From the southwest corner of the first antechamber a 3-meter
        corridor
        leads to the northeast corner of the second antechamber, which is exactly in the middle of the pyramid. At a
        height of
        7.6 meters on the south side of the chamber is the entrance to another 7-meter corridor that leads to the actual
        burial
        chamber. The wooden staircase in the second antechamber is a modern construction to enable visitors to enter the
        burial
        chamber.</p>
    <p>The actual burial chamber dimensions are 8.55 m x 4.18 m with a height of 14.67 m with a height of 14.67 m.
        Unlike the
        two antechambers, they are oriented in the east-west direction, which was an innovation in the construction of
        the
        pyramid. No coffin remains have been found. The room itself was badly damaged by tomb robbers who tore several
        layers of
        floor stones. The ceilings and walls are black with soot, which may be due to the torches and the possibility of
        the
        wooden coffin being burned by grave robbers. When it was reopened by Bering, the room was partially covered with
        limestone, which probably came from a Ramesside restoration. When the room was cleaned by Abdus Salam Hussain in
        1950,
        both masonry and loose stones were removed from the floor and lost without documentation. Follow-up examinations
        by
        Stadelmann can no longer provide any information about the remains of the original chamber contents</p>

    pyramid complex <br>
    Unlike other pyramids of the Fourth Dynasty, the Red Pyramid does not have a cult pyramid. This item may have been
    excluded ,because the nearby leaning pyramid of Sneferu assumed its function as a symbolic southern tomb.</P>
    <p>The remains of the temple road have not yet been found, although it was certainly planned between the valley and
        the
        mortuary temple. However, this may not have been completed or even begun.</p>
    <p>A larger brick building was found southeast of the complex, which apparently housed workshops. The remains of a
        furnace
        were also found there </p>
    <h4> perimeter wall</H4>
    <p>During the excavations of Stadelmann, the remains of a mud brick building were found in the northeastern corner
        of the
        pyramid, which was directly adjacent to a wall also made of mud bricks. The exact purpose of the building has
        not yet
        been determined, but the association with the cult of the ruler is clear.Further exploratory excavations could
        prove the surrounding wall around the pyramid. Part of the wall was covered with
        limestone. The distance between the wall and the pyramid varies from four sides: 15 to 16 meters on the northern
        and
        southern sides, 19 meters on the western side and 26 meters on the eastern side. Unlike the curved pyramid wall,
        it is
        not square, but slightly from east to west. Stadelmann interprets the fact that the wall was built of adobe
        rather than limestone like a curved pyramid as evidence
        that it was built in a hurry to complete the complex. The northeastern building appears to have been a later
        addition,
        as the walls were not connected to the perimeter wall.</p>
    <h4>mortuary temple</h4>
    <p>Funeral structure of the Red Pyramid The mortuary temple has been largely destroyed and has only been preserved
        in the form of a few primitive ruins. It is
        not yet the size of the funerary temples of the later pyramids. In the center of the temple was an offering site
        with a
        false door in the inner temple. A memorial plaque as with the older Sneferu pyramids cannot be discovered here.
        There
        was a stone chapel on either side of the open courtyard. It is no longer possible to determine whether these
        chapels
        were stand-alone buildings or were combined with the courtyard and inner temple to form a building complex. The
        courtyards to the north and south of the temple contain circular depressions, which may have once been used as
        plant
        pits or for offerings. The magazine rooms in the outer area of ​​the temple were made of adobe. It appears that
        the
        mortuary temple was not hastily completed until after the death of Sneferu, which is evidenced by the change in
        building
        materials from limestone to mud bricks.</p>
    <h4>Valley Temple</h4>
    <p>During agricultural work in the spring of 1904, the remains of a 100 m x 65 m limestone fence wall were
        discovered. In
        the southeast corner of the walls was a memorial plaque with a decree of the pharaoh Baby I Ludwig Borchardt,
        who
        secured the stele, holding this find to the wall surrounding the pyramidal city. Stadelmann sees it as the
        perimeter of
        the valley temple, since the walls of the pyramidal cities (except at Giza) were made of adobe. The wall that
        was found
        is 3.65 square meters thick, made of yellow limestone, and the white sloping facades on both sides correspond in
        its
        execution to the sacred architecture. However, there have been no further systematic investigations and the
        remains
        cannot now be accessed on farmland.</p>
